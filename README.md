# LLM-Forge

## Overview

**LLM-Forge** is a project aimed at building a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch, using custom Transformer architechtures. The project implements two primary models:

1. **Bigram Model** : A simple language model that predicts the next word based on the previous word.
2. **GPT Model** : A more complex generative pre-trained transformer model designed for generating coherent and contextually relevant text.

This project serves as an exploration into the fundamentals of language models and the intricacies of transformer architectures. The aim is to provide insights and tools for developing custom LLMs using Python and popular deep learning libraries.
